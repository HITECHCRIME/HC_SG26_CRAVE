CHORUS x3 in the song?

all people want or need
beyond their reach

-- we're not free, dreams

out of my tracks
sow what you reap

inside my mind

all people want or need
beyond their reach

-- we're not free, dreams

out of my tracks
sow what you reap

(inside my mind)

all people want or need
beyond their reach, 
-- we're not free, dreams
out of my tracks
sow what you reap
inside my mind

**VERSE 1**
endlessly furious, never I get
lusting (longing) after your marks inside my head  
smile's too sweet - course through my veins 
with no effect fuck

**CHORUS**
every damn time 
every crush dies              
all of the nights
give me that handpoke or slit my throat 
feel the shame - how about my crave ye

just put your hand against my neck, 
slow the bleed, slow the bleed
slow the bleed, slow the bleeed ye

**VERSE 2**
let me crown my thoughts that rage against
feed of cravings that bind and chain to me   
puncture not bind that's what you did bitch ???

we're blocking and throwing ourselves
against our own minds, fighting chance
all people want or need
beyond their reach, we're not free
stay out of dreams, out of my tracks
sow what you reap
inside my mind
crops

0:16
constantly furious, never I get
lusting after your marks inside my head
smile's too sweet - course through my veins 
with no effect fuck






```
