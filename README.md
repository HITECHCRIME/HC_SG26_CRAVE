**INTRO**
all people want or need
beyond their reach, we're not free
stay out of dreams, out of my tracks
sow what you reap
inside my mind
crops

0:16
constantly furious, never I get
lusting after your marks inside my head
smile's too sweet - course through my veins 
with no effect fuck




**VERSE 1**
endlessly furious, never I get
lusting (longing) after your marks inside my head  
smile's too sweet - course through my veins 
with no effect fuck

**CHORUS**
every damn time 
every crush dies              
all of the nights
give me that handpoke or slit my throat 
feel the shame - how about my crave ye

just put your hand against my neck, 
slow the bleed, slow the bleed
slow the bleed, slow the bleeed ye

**VERSE 2**
let me crown my thoughts that rage against
feed of cravings that bind and chain to me   
puncture not bind that's what you did bitch ???
