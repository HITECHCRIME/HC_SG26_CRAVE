constantly furious, never I get
lusting after your marks inside my head
smile's too sweet - course through my veins 
with no effect fuck

all people want or need, beyond their reach, we're not free
stay out of my dreams, out of my tracks
sow what you reap
inside, my mind
crops

**VERSE 1**
endlessly furious, never I get
lusting after your marks inside my head
smile's too sweet - course through my veins 
with no effect fuck

**CHORUS**
every damn time 
every crush dies 
all of the nights
give me that handpoke or slit my throat 
feel the shame - how about my crave ye

just put your hand against my neck, 
slow the bleed, slow the bleed
slow the bleed, slow the bleeed ye

**VERSE 2**



of the cravings, bind and chain to me
bind to me bitch









let me crown my thoughts that rage against
my feed,
