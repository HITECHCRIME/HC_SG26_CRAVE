endlessly furious, never I get
lusting after your marks inside my head
smile's too sweet - course through my veins 
with no effect fuck
every damn time 
every crush dies 
all of the nights
give me that handpoke or slit my throat 
feelin the shame - how about my crave ye
just put your hand against my neck, 
slow the bleed, slow the bleed
slow the bleed, slow the bleeed ye

all the people I want or need
beyond the reach, I'm not free of

cravings bind and chains to me
bind to me


now please stay out of my dreams
out of my tracks



let me crown my thoughts that rage against
my feed,
